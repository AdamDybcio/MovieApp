# MovieApp

I will not hide that this is the most difficult application I have done so far (and I am still working on new features). It looks like this (version 1.0.1):

## Cons of the application:
- there are some bugs and shortcomings
- too little functionality

## What have i learned:
- I understand BLoC pattern a bit more
- I understand a little more how to use RxDart
- connecting my application with the TMDB API
- getting to know some new libraries and widgets in Flutter
- combining it all into one
and many other less important things ...

### I would like to point out that I will be sitting on this application a little longer, adding new functionalities and improving this application!
